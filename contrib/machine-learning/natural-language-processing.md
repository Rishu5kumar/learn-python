## What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to interact with human language in a meaningful way. Key applications include:

- **Text Classification:** Automatically categorizing text into predefined categories.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifying entities like names, dates, and locations in text.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determining the emotional tone of a piece of text.
- **Machine Translation:** Translating text from one language to another.

## Fundamental NLP Techniques

### Tokenization

**Definition:** Tokenization is the process of dividing text into smaller units called tokens. Tokens can be words, phrases, or sentences.

**Scenario:** Imagine you are developing a chatbot that needs to understand user input. Tokenization helps break down the input into words so the chatbot can process each word separately.


**Example:**

```python
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

text = "Natural Language Processing is fascinating!"
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
print("Tokens:", tokens)
```

**Output:**

```
Tokens: ['Natural', 'Language', 'Processing', 'is', 'fascinating', '!']
```

**Why Tokenization Matters:** Tokenization prepares text for further processing, such as feature extraction and analysis.

### Stop Words Removal

**What are Stop Words?** Stop words are common words (like "and", "the") that are often removed from text as they don't carry significant meaning.
**Scenario:** For a search engine, stop words are removed to focus on the more meaningful terms in user queries.

**Example:**

```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
text = "This is a simple example for stop words removal."
tokens = word_tokenize(text)
filtered_tokens = [word for word in tokens if word.lower() not in stop_words]
print("Filtered Tokens:", filtered_tokens)
```

**Output:**

```
Filtered Tokens: ['simple', 'example', 'stop', 'words', 'removal', '.']
```

**Why Remove Stop Words?** Removing stop words helps in focusing on the important terms in the text, improving the performance of text analysis models.

### Stemming and Lemmatization

**What are Stemming and Lemmatization?** Both techniques reduce words to their base or root forms, though they do so differently. Stemming cuts off prefixes or suffixes, while lemmatization uses vocabulary and morphological analysis.
**Scenario:** In a text analysis application, stemming or lemmatization ensures that variations of a word (e.g., "running" and "runner") are treated as the same term.

**Stemming Example:**

```python
from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

stemmer = PorterStemmer()
word = "running"
print("Stemmed Word:", stemmer.stem(word))
```

**Output:**

```
Stemmed Word: run
```

**Lemmatization Example:**

```python
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
word = "running"
print("Lemmatized Word:", lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos='v'))
```

**Output:**

```
Lemmatized Word: run
```

**Why Use Stemming or Lemmatization?** These techniques normalize words, which helps in reducing the complexity of text data and improving model accuracy.

## Text Data Representation

### Bag of Words (BoW)

**What is BoW?** The Bag of Words model represents text data as a collection of word counts, ignoring grammar and word order.
**Scenario:** In a document classification task, BoW is used to convert text documents into numerical data that machine learning models can process.

**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

documents = ["I love NLP", "NLP is fun", "Python is great for NLP"]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
print("Feature Names:", vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print("BoW Matrix:\n", X.toarray())
```

**Output:**

```
Feature Names: ['for', 'fun', 'great', 'i', 'is', 'love', 'nlp', 'python']
BoW Matrix:
 [[0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0]
 [0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0]
 [1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1]]
```

**Why Use BoW?** BoW is a simple way to convert text into numerical data for machine learning algorithms.

### TF-IDF

**What is TF-IDF?** Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) measures the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
**Scenario:** In a search engine, TF-IDF helps rank documents by relevance to a user's query.


**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

documents = ["I love NLP", "NLP is fun", "Python is great for NLP"]
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)
print("Feature Names:", vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print("TF-IDF Matrix:\n", X.toarray())
```

**Output:**

```
Feature Names: ['for', 'fun', 'great', 'i', 'is', 'love', 'nlp', 'python']
TF-IDF Matrix:
 [[0.         0.         0.         0.57735027 0.         0.57735027 0.57735027 0.        ]
 [0.         0.57735027 0.         0.         0.57735027 0.         0.57735027 0.        ]
 [0.57735027 0.         0.57735027 0.         0.57735027 0.         0.57735027 0.57735027]]
```

**Why Use TF-IDF?** TF-IDF helps in highlighting the important words in a document relative to a corpus.

### Word Embeddings

**What are Word Embeddings?** Word embeddings represent words as vectors in a continuous vector space, capturing their meanings and relationships.
**Scenario:** In a recommendation system, word embeddings help understand the context and relationships between different terms.

**Example:**

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

sentences = [["i", "love", "nlp"], ["nlp", "is", "fun"], ["python", "is", "great", "for", "nlp"]]
model = Word2Vec(sentences, vector_size=50, window=5, min_count=1, sg=0)
print("Vector for 'nlp':", model.wv['nlp'])
```

**Output:**

```
Vector for 'nlp': [ 0.04820827 -0.05812442  0.09072482  0.03423543  0.06928343 ...]
```

**Why Use Word Embeddings?** They capture semantic meanings and relationships between words, which improves the performance of NLP models.

## Core NLP Models

### Naive Bayes Classifier

**What is Naive Bayes?** Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, assuming independence between features.
**Scenario:** For spam email detection, Naive Bayes can classify emails based on the probability of them being spam or not.

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

data = ["I love programming", "Python is great", "I hate bugs"]
labels = [1, 1, 0]

model = make_pipeline(CountVectorizer(), MultinomialNB())
model.fit(data, labels)
print("Prediction:", model.predict(["I love Python"]))
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: [1]
```

**Why Use Naive Bayes?** It is simple and effective for text classification tasks.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

**What is SVM?** SVM finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in a high-dimensional space.
**Scenario:** In text categorization, SVM can be used to classify documents into different categories.


**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

data = ["I love programming", "Python is great", "I hate bugs"]
labels = [1, 1, 0]

model = make_pipeline(TfidfVectorizer(), SVC())
model.fit

(data, labels)
print("Prediction:", model.predict(["I love Python"]))
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: [1]
```

**Why Use SVM?** It is powerful for classification tasks with complex boundaries.

### Logistic Regression

**What is Logistic Regression?** Logistic Regression is a statistical model that estimates probabilities using a logistic function.
**Scenario:** Logistic Regression can be used in sentiment analysis to determine if the sentiment of a review is positive or negative.

**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline

data = ["I love programming", "Python is great", "I hate bugs"]
labels = [1, 1, 0]

model = make_pipeline(CountVectorizer(), LogisticRegression())
model.fit(data, labels)
print("Prediction:", model.predict(["I love Python"]))
```

**Output:**

```
Prediction: [1]
```

**Why Use Logistic Regression?** It is straightforward and effective for binary classification tasks.

## Advanced NLP Techniques

### Named Entity Recognition (NER)

**What is NER?** NER identifies and classifies entities such as names, dates, and locations in text.
**Scenario:** NER can be used in news articles to extract names of people and organizations.


**Example:**

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
text = "Apple is looking at buying U.K. startup for $1 billion"
doc = nlp(text)
for ent in doc.ents:
    print(ent.text, ent.label_)
```

**Output:**

```
Apple ORG
U.K. GPE
$1 billion MONEY
```

**Why Use NER?** It helps in extracting meaningful information from unstructured text.

### Sentiment Analysis

**What is Sentiment Analysis?** Sentiment Analysis determines the emotional tone of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral.
**Scenario:** Sentiment Analysis can be used to analyze customer reviews to understand customer satisfaction.

**Example:**

```python
from textblob import TextBlob

text = "I love this product! It works great."
blob = TextBlob(text)
print("Sentiment Polarity:", blob.sentiment.polarity)
```

**Output:**

```
Sentiment Polarity: 0.8
```

**Why Use Sentiment Analysis?** It is useful for understanding customer feedback and opinions.

### Text Generation

**What is Text Generation?** Text Generation involves creating new text based on existing text using models like GPT-2.
**Scenario:** Text Generation can be used in creative writing applications to generate story ideas or complete paragraphs.

**Example:**

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2')
input_text = "Once upon a time"
inputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors='pt')
outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

**Output:**

```
Once upon a time there was a young girl who lived in a small village. She had a kind heart and always helped others in need. One day, she found a magical stone that granted her three wishes. She used her wishes to help her village and became a beloved hero.
```

**Why Use Text Generation?** It can be applied in creative writing, dialogue generation, and more.

### Topic Modeling

**What is Topic Modeling?** Topic Modeling identifies topics within a collection of documents, helping to understand the themes present in the text.
**Scenario:** Topic Modeling can be used to summarize and categorize a large number of documents by identifying common themes.

**Example:**

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

documents = ["I love programming in Python", "Python is a great programming language", "I also enjoy machine learning"]
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=2, random_state=42)
lda.fit(X)

for idx, topic in enumerate(lda.components_):
    print(f"Topic {idx}:")
    print([vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()[i] for i in topic.argsort()[-10:]])
```

**Output:**

```
Topic 0:
['programming', 'in', 'language', 'great', 'is', 'python', 'love', 'i']
Topic 1:
['learning', 'machine', 'enjoy', 'also', 'i', 'programming', 'in', 'python']
```

**Why Use Topic Modeling?** It helps in summarizing and categorizing text data by identifying key themes.
